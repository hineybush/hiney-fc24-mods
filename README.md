# hiney-fc24-mods
Mods and scripts to customize FC24 for PC. These are initially for my own experimentation and for learning LUA and the filesystem of FIFA/FC24. I may release things as mods as I go.

### Plans/Ideas:

<ul>
  <li>YA overhaul</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Improve distribution of attributes</li>
    <li>Adjust distribution of positions to allow more "overall good" types of players</li>
    <li>Increase link between wingback/wide mid type players</li>
    <li>Increase age range of players (13-18ish), decrease min age for promotion (15?)</li>
    <li>Dynamic heights/weights/bodytypes based on YA player age</li>
    <li>Dynamic boot mapping</li>
    <li>Dynamic hair/realistic facial hair (no bears for 13 year olds, etc)</li>
    <li>Increase # of traits and chance of traits per player</li>
    <li>Adjust "allowed" traits per player/player type </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Training plans overhaul</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Rename some training plans</li>
      <li>Adjust trained attributes for some training plans</li>
      <li>Allow more than one of work rate/skill moves/weak foot per training plan</li>
      <li>Change which positions training plans are applicable to (wingbacks/wide mids for example)</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Dynamic boot mapping - change player boots based on their boot brand/model</li>
  <li>Adjustments to seasonal kit changes (long sleeves, etc)</li>
</ul>
